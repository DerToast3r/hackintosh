Here you find my working EFI folder. The USB Ports are mapped for a Gigabyte z390M mainboard (Non gaming!).
You have to enter valid system information (serial numbers) on your own.

In case you use a different mainboard, but same processor generation: I did the USB mapping with the tool from https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool
You can create your USBMap.kext and exchange it. But, you need a running windows installation for that.



Good Luck and have fun!
