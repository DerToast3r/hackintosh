Here you find my working EFI folder. The USB Ports are mapped for a Asus B550-f Wifi mainboard.
You have to enter valid system information (serial numbers) on your own.

It was booting without a GPU, but MacOS doesnt support the AMD integrated graphics of the used Ryzen 7 5700G processor.

In case you use a different mainboard, but same processor generation: I did the USB mapping with the tool from https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool
You can create your USBMap.kext and exchange it. But, you need a running windows installation for that.



Good Luck and have fun!
